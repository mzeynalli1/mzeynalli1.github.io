I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics at Miami University in Ohio. I received my PhD in Economics from Louisiana State University in August 2025.

I specialize in **Labor Economics** with a particular focus on the **Economics of Immigration**. My research examines how historical immigration-driven regional shifts and contemporary immigration policies affect workers, industries, and firms. I integrate applied microeconometric methods with survey, administrative, and proprietory data to advance academic understanding and provide insights for policymaking.

At Miami, I teach Principles of Macroeconomics, emphasizing analytical tools for understanding economic issues and continually improving my teaching to ensure effective learning.

**I am on the 2025-2026 job market.**
