I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics at Miami University in Ohio. I received my MS and PhD in Economics from Louisiana State University.

I specialize in **Labor Economics** with a particular focus on the **Economics of Immigration**. My research examines how historical immigration-driven regional shifts and contemporary immigration policies affect workers, industries, and firms.
