I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics at Miami University in Ohio. I received my PhD in Economics from Louisiana State University in August 2025.

I specialize in **Labor Economics** with a particular focus on the **Economics of Immigration** and **regional labor market dynamics**. My research examines how historical ancestry-driven regional shifts and contemporary immigration policies affect workers, industries, and firms across local economies. I integrate applied microeconometric methods with survey, administrative, and proprietory data to advance academic understanding and provide insights for policymaking.

At Miami, I teach introductory macroeconomics and continue to advance my research agenda.

<em>Recipient of the <strong>Excellence in Teaching Award</strong>, Department of Economics, LSU (2024)</em>.

**I am on the 2025-2026 job market.**
